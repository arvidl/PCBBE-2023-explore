4. **Predictive Analysis**: AI can predict patient needs or emotional states based on data, potentially allowing healthcare providers to offer emotional support proactively.

**What AI Cannot Do:**

1. **Genuine Understanding**: AI does not have feelings, consciousness, or subjective experiences, so it cannot genuinely understand or share human emotions.

2. **Ethical and Moral Considerations**: AI lacks the ability to make ethical or moral judgments, which are often crucial when dealing with sensitive medical issues.

3. **Complex Emotional Nuance**: Human emotions are complex and often influenced by a range of factors that AI may not be equipped to understand, such as cultural nuances, personal history, or even the "vibe" of a situation.

4. **Building Trust**: While AI can mimic empathetic behavior, many people may not fully trust a machine in the same way they would a human healthcare provider, especially in emotionally charged situations.

**Hybrid Approaches:**
Given these limitations, a hybrid approach that combines AI's data-processing capabilities with human emotional intelligence is often considered the most effective solution. For example, AI could handle routine tasks and initial assessments, freeing up human healthcare providers to focus on more complex and emotionally nuanced interactions with patients.
In summary, while AI can mimic certain aspects of empathy and can be designed to respond in ways that are emotionally sensitive, it lacks the genuine emotional understanding and ethical reasoning that are core to human empathy. Therefore, while AI can assist in healthcare settings in numerous ways, the empathetic aspect of care is something that, for the foreseeable future, will likely require a human touch.

<!--
The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) is known for its challenging questions that test both diagnostic reasoning and clinical problem-solving skills. Below are two hypothetical examples inspired by the types of questions that might appear on the USMLE. These examples are designed to illustrate the complexity and depth of reasoning required for medical licensure.
-->

**Example 1: Acute Chest Pain**
Presentation:

- A 55-year-old male presents to the ER with acute chest pain radiating to the left arm.
- Vital signs: BP 150/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 18/min, Temp 98.6°F
- ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF.

Diagnostic Reasoning:

1. **Differential Diagnosis**: Acute myocardial infarction (MI), angina, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism.
2. **Key Findings**: ST-segment elevation and radiating chest pain strongly suggest acute MI.
3. **Next Steps**: Immediate administration of aspirin, nitroglycerin, and initiation of thrombolytic therapy or cardiac catheterization.

Clinical Problem-Solving:

- The patient's symptoms, ECG findings, and risk factors (age, hypertension) point to an acute MI.
- Immediate intervention is crucial to minimize myocardial damage.
----------

**Example 2: Unexplained Weight Loss**
Presentation:

- A 35-year-old female presents with a 6-month history of unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and intermittent diarrhea.
- Physical exam reveals skin hyperpigmentation.
- Lab tests show hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.

Diagnostic Reasoning:

1. **Differential Diagnosis**: Addison's disease, hyperthyroidism, malabsorption syndromes, malignancy.
2. **Key Findings**: Hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia are classic signs of Addison's disease.
3. **Next Steps**: Confirmatory tests such as ACTH stimulation test and measurement of serum ACTH levels.

Clinical Problem-Solving:

- The patient's symptoms and lab findings are highly suggestive of Addison's disease, an adrenal insufficiency.

![dia_09](./assets/dia_09.png)


<!--
Certainly! The design of a clinical study to better understand Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) involving microbiota and the brain-gut axis would require a multidisciplinary approach. Here's a hypothetical study design:
-->

**Title:**
**"Investigating the Role of Microbiota and Brain-Gut Axis in the Pathophysiology and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)"**
**Objectives:**

1. To identify specific changes in gut microbiota associated with IBS symptoms.
2. To explore the relationship between the brain-gut axis and IBS symptomatology.
3. To evaluate the efficacy of targeted microbiota modulation in alleviating IBS symptoms.

**Study Design:**

1. **Type of Study**: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
2. **Duration**: 2 years
3. **Sample Size**: 500 participants (250 IBS patients, 250 healthy controls)

**Inclusion Criteria:**

1. Adults aged 18-65
2. Diagnosis of IBS based on Rome IV criteria for the patient group
3. No history of gastrointestinal disease for the control group

**Exclusion Criteria:**

1. Pregnancy
2. Use of antibiotics or probiotics within the last 3 months
3. Other chronic gastrointestinal diseases

**Methodology:**
Phase 1: Baseline Assessment

1. **Questionnaires**: To assess IBS symptoms, quality of life, and psychological stress.
2. **Blood Tests**: To measure markers of inflammation and stress hormones.
3. **Stool Samples**: To analyze gut microbiota composition.
4. **Brain Imaging**: fMRI scans to assess brain-gut interactions.

Phase 2: Intervention

1. **Randomization**: IBS patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:
    - Probiotic supplementation
    - Prebiotic supplementation
    - Placebo
2. **Duration**: 12 weeks of intervention

Phase 3: Post-Intervention Assessment

1. Repeat all assessments from Phase 1.
2. Compare pre- and post-intervention data within and between groups.

**Data Analysis:**

1. Use multivariate statistical methods to identify correlations between gut microbiota, brain-gut axis activity, and IBS symptoms.
2. Use machine learning algorithms to identify potential predictive markers for treatment response.

**Expected Outcomes:**

1. Identification of specific microbiota profiles associated with IBS.
2. Insights into how the brain-gut axis may contribute to IBS symptoms.
3. Preliminary data on the efficacy of microbiota-targeted interventions for IBS.

**Ethical Considerations:**

### (_See the accompanying [Jupyter notebook](./code/03-ibs-simstudy.ipynb) for the complete simulation_)

![res_10](./assets/res_10.png)

Below is a simplified Python code snippet to simulate the data for the study and some suggestions for methods to analyze the data. Note that this is a very basic simulation and doesn't capture the full complexity of a real-world study.
**Simulating the Data**
We'll use the `pandas` library for data manipulation and the `numpy` library for numerical operations to simulate the data.

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    
    # Create an empty DataFrame
    columns = ['Participant_ID', 'Group', 'Baseline_IBS_Symptoms', 'Baseline_Stress_Level',
               'Baseline_Microbiota_Diversity', 'Post_IBS_Symptoms', 'Post_Stress_Level', 'Post_Microbiota_Diversity']
    df = pd.DataFrame(columns=columns)
    
    # Simulate data for 500 participants
    for i in range(500):
        participant_id = i + 1
    
        # Assign group (1: Probiotic, 2: Prebiotic, 3: Placebo, 4: Control)
        if i < 125:
            group = 1
        elif i < 250:
            group = 2
        elif i < 375:
            group = 3
        else:
            group = 4
    
        # Simulate baseline data
        baseline_IBS_symptoms = np.random.randint(0, 100) if group != 4 else np.random.randint(0, 20)
        baseline_stress_level = np.random.randint(0, 100)
        baseline_microbiota_diversity = np.random.uniform(0, 1)
    
        # Simulate post-intervention data
        if group == 1:  # Probiotic
            post_IBS_symptoms = baseline_IBS_symptoms - np.random.randint(5, 20)
        elif group == 2:  # Prebiotic
            post_IBS_symptoms = baseline_IBS_symptoms - np.random.randint(0, 10)
        elif group == 3:  # Placebo
            post_IBS_symptoms = baseline_IBS_symptoms + np.random.randint(-5, 5)
        else:  # Control
            post_IBS_symptoms = baseline_IBS_symptoms + np.random.randint(-5, 5)
    
        post_stress_level = baseline_stress_level + np.random.randint(-10, 10)
        post_microbiota_diversity = baseline_microbiota_diversity + np.random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
    
        # Append to DataFrame
        df.loc[i] = [participant_id, group, baseline_IBS_symptoms, baseline_stress_level,
                     baseline_microbiota_diversity, post_IBS_symptoms, post_stress_level, post_microbiota_diversity]
    
    # Save DataFrame to CSV file
    df.to_csv('simulated_IBS_study_data.csv', index=False)

**Suggested Methods for Analysis**

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate means, medians, and standard deviations for all variables at baseline and post-intervention.
2. **ANOVA or t-tests**: To compare the means of IBS symptoms, stress levels, and microbiota diversity between the different groups.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: To investigate relationships between variables.
4. **Regression Analysis**: To identify predictors of treatment response.
5. **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest or Support Vector Machines could be used to predict treatment outcomes based on baseline variables.

You can use libraries like `scikit-learn` for machine learning models, `statsmodels` for statistical models, and `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for data visualization.
This is a simplified example, and real-world data would require more complex statistical methods and data cleaning steps.

### Data analysis:

![dia_11](./assets/dia_11.png)

<!--
Certainly! Below is Python code that performs each of the suggested analyses on the simulated data. We'll use `pandas` for data manipulation, `scikit-learn` for machine learning, `statsmodels` for statistical models, and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
-->

First, let's read the data:

    import pandas as pd
    
    # Read the data
    df = pd.read_csv('./data/simulated_IBS_study_data.csv')

**1. Descriptive Statistics**

    # Calculate descriptive statistics
    print("Descriptive Statistics:")
    print(df.describe())

**2. ANOVA or t-tests**
We'll use the `scipy.stats` library to perform t-tests.

    from scipy import stats
    
    # Perform t-tests for IBS symptoms between groups
    for i in range(1, 5):
        for j in range(i+1, 5):
            t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(df\[df['Group'] == i\]['Post_IBS_Symptoms'], df\[df['Group'] == j\]['Post_IBS_Symptoms'])
            print(f"T-test between Group {i} and Group {j} for Post_IBS_Symptoms: t = {t_stat}, p = {p_val}")

**3. Correlation Analysis**

    # Calculate correlation matrix
    print("Correlation Matrix:")
    print(df.corr())

**4. Regression Analysis**
We'll use `statsmodels` to perform a simple linear regression.

    import statsmodels.api as sm
    
    # Simple linear regression to predict Post_IBS_Symptoms based on Baseline_IBS_Symptoms
    X = df['Baseline_IBS_Symptoms']
    y = df['Post_IBS_Symptoms']
    X = sm.add_constant(X)  # Adds a constant term to the predictor
    
    model = sm.OLS(y, X)
    result = model.fit()
    
    print(result.summary())

**5. Machine Learning Models**
We'll use a Random Forest model from `scikit-learn` to predict `Post_IBS_Symptoms`.

    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    
    # Prepare data
    X = df[['Baseline_IBS_Symptoms', 'Baseline_Stress_Level', 'Baseline_Microbiota_Diversity']]
    y = df['Post_IBS_Symptoms']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    # Train Random Forest model
    rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Make predictions
    y_pred = rf.predict(X_test)
    
    # Evaluate the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

This should give you a good starting point for analyzing the data. Note that this is a simplified example and real-world data would require more complex statistical methods and data cleaning steps.

![dia_12](./assets/dia_12.png)

<!--
Certainly! Visualizations can provide valuable insights into the data and the performance of machine learning models. Below is Python code for generating some exploratory plots as well as graphs related to the machine learning model's feature importance.
First, let's import the necessary libraries and read the data:
-->


    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    import shap
    
    # Read the data
    df = pd.read_csv('./data/simulated_IBS_study_data.csv')

**Exploratory Plots**

**1. Histograms for Baseline and Post-Intervention IBS Symptoms**

    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    sns.histplot(df['Baseline_IBS_Symptoms'], bins=20, kde=True)
    plt.title('Baseline IBS Symptoms')
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    sns.histplot(df['Post_IBS_Symptoms'], bins=20, kde=True)
    plt.title('Post-Intervention IBS Symptoms')
    plt.show()

**2. Boxplot for Post-Intervention IBS Symptoms by Group**

    sns.boxplot(x='Group', y='Post_IBS_Symptoms', data=df)
    plt.title('Post-Intervention IBS Symptoms by Group')
    plt.show()

**Machine Learning Model and Feature Importance**

**1. Train Random Forest Model**

    # Prepare data
    X = df[['Baseline_IBS_Symptoms', 'Baseline_Stress_Level', 'Baseline_Microbiota_Diversity']]
    y = df['Post_IBS_Symptoms']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    # Train Random Forest model
    rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

**2. Feature Importance using Permutation Importance**

    from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance
    
    result = permutation_importance(rf, X_test, y_test, n_repeats=30, random_state=42)
    sorted_idx = result.importances_mean.argsort()
    
    plt.barh(range(X_test.shape[1]), result.importances_mean[sorted_idx])
    plt.yticks(range(X_test.shape[1]), X_test.columns[sorted_idx])
    plt.xlabel('Permutation Importance')
    plt.show()

**3. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) Values**

    # Calculate SHAP values
    explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(rf)
    shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)
    
    # Plot summary plot
    shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test, plot_type="bar")

These plots should provide a comprehensive view of both the data and the machine learning model's performance. The feature importance plots, in particular, can help you understand which variables are most influential in predicting post-intervention IBS symptoms.

### Casting a regression problem to a classification problem:

![dia_13](./assets/dia_13.png)


<!--
To create a three-class problem with equi-probable classes, you can divide the `Post_IBS_Symptoms` into three quantiles: low, medium, and high. This will ensure that each class has an approximately equal number of instances.
Here's how you can implement this:
-->

    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, classification_report
    
    # Divide 'Post_IBS_Symptoms' into quantiles to create three equi-probable classes
    labels = ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']
    y_train_class = pd.qcut(y_train, q=3, labels=labels)
    y_test_class = pd.qcut(y_test, q=3, labels=labels)
    
    # Convert labels to numerical values for scikit-learn
    y_train_class = y_train_class.cat.codes
    y_test_class = y_test_class.cat.codes
    
    # Train a Random Forest Classifier
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train_class)
    
    # Make predictions
    y_pred_class = clf.predict(X_test)
    
    # Generate the confusion matrix
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test_class, y_pred_class)
    print("Confusion Matrix:")
    print(cm)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    print("Classification Report:")
    print(classification_report(y_test_class, y_pred_class, target_names=labels))

This will output the confusion matrix and a classification report that includes metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
By using quantiles to define the classes, you ensure that each class has roughly the same number of instances, making them equi-probable.

### The confusion matrix:

![dia_14](./assets/dia_14.png)

<!--
Certainly! You can use the `heatmap` function from the `seaborn` library to display the confusion matrix graphically. Annotations can be added to show the actual numbers in each cell of the matrix, as well as derived metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
Here's how you can do it:
-->

    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
    
    # Generate the confusion matrix (assuming y_test_class and y_pred_class are already defined)
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test_class, y_pred_class)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    report = classification_report(y_test_class, y_pred_class, target_names=labels, output_dict=True)
    
    # Create a heatmap
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
    sns.set(font_scale=1.2)
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='g', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=labels, yticklabels=labels)
    
    # Add metrics annotations
    for i in range(len(labels)):
        for j in range(len(labels)):
            plt.text(j+0.5, i+0.7,
                     f"Precision: {report\[labels[i]\]['precision']:.2f}\nRecall: {report\[labels[i]\]['recall']:.2f}\nF1: {report\[labels[i]\]['f1-score']:.2f}",
                     horizontalalignment='center',
                     verticalalignment='center',
                     fontsize=12,
                     color='red')
    
    plt.title('Confusion Matrix with Metrics')
    plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
    plt.ylabel('True Label')
    plt.show()

In this example, the confusion matrix is displayed as a heatmap with the actual numbers of instances in each cell. Additionally, precision, recall, and F1-score for each class are annotated in red within the corresponding cells.
This should give you a comprehensive view of the model's performance across the three classes.

## EXTRA (on the panel debate)

![extra_1](./assets/extra_1.png)

**The panel debate invitation:**

Dear All,
 
On behalf of the Organizing Committee of the Polish Conference on Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering 2023, I would like to thank you for agreeing to take part in the debate on artificial intelligence in medicine. The motto of the discussion is the question: ***If AI is going to replace a medical doctor?***
 
Having a broad perspective of the applications, but also limitations of machine learning methods in biocybernetics and biomedical engineering, you will certainly find arguments to both support or reject the thesis hidden in the title question. However, in order to make the discussion more interesting and attractive for the listeners, we would like to ask 2 speakers to stand - perhaps even a little despite doubts - on the side of the supporters of the affirmative answer, and 2 on the opposition side.
 
A "natural" division resulting from your main research profiles would be as follows:
 
Answer YES:
1. Prof. Y $_1$
2. Prof. Y $_2$
 
Answer NO:
1. Prof. N $_1$ 
2. Prof. N $_2$ 
 
If any of you, however, would like to change the side, then I think it would be even more engaging.
 
The debate will be moderated by prof. X of the Lodz University of Technology, a specialist in the design of artificial intelligence algorithms, who will propose detailed topics for discussion. The presumed discourse format comprises of 2-3 rounds of your statements on the topics presented by the moderator, with the option of referring to the adversarial voice. This scenario is of course only a suggestion and can be dynamically modified even during the dispute to keep the conversation lively.
 
We also want to get conference participants involved in the debate. If time permits, there will be an opportunity for the audience to ask questions. Above all, however, in the end, there will be a vote among the listeners, who will also answer the question raised in the title of the debate.
 
Eventually, I would like to ask Prof. X for further tips for the panelists and possible clarification of the format of the conversation.
 
According to the information provided earlier, the debate will take place on September 28 (Thursday) at 3 p.m. (1 hour). 
 
Once again, many thanks to all of you for your involvement and invaluable contribution to the success of PCBBE 2023.
 
See you in Łódź!

### Finally:

![extra_3](./assets/extra_3.png)

**From Prof. X:**


"Dear Colleagues,
    I am very happy that we will have the opportunity to debate **whether AI is going to replace a medical doctor**?
The topic is interesting and not obvious, so I am glad that some will take the role of enthusiasts and some skeptics. For the sake of the fluidity of the discussion, I would like to consult possible issues that could be raised during the debate:

1. In the first round I would like to go in the spirit of recent media articles that relate to AI. Some claim that "AI will deprive people of jobs," while others claim that "thanks to AI, people will no longer have to work." Is this kind of discourse also taking place in the medical field?
2. In your opinion, is/can AI be trusted, and what realistically stands in the way of building trust between AI and doctors? Can such trust be built and possibly how?
3. In the context of trust, can you give examples of AI solutions that work successfully in medicine and such examples that cannot or will be difficult to gain acceptance?
4. In view of the shortage of doctors, can AI be a solution to social problems? Is it better to open more medical faculties that don't have access to adequate facilities (experts, hospitals, laboratories) for medicine or to take advantage of AI that has global expertise?
5. I would also like to touch on the real possibilities of using AI in a doctor's professional work. Is it allowed or forbidden? Does the medical community, similar to, for example, the artistic community, try to boycott the development of AI, or, like journalists or computer scientists, facilitate their work as much as possible?
6. Now moving a bit away from current issues and challenges. Can AI help provide new medical knowledge, or, as an excellent interpolator of existing medical knowledge, will it be reproductive, and in critical situations introduce misinformation?
7. To conclude, I would like enthusiasts to give examples of an aspect of AI in which it will always be better than humans, while skeptics point out medical competencies that are unsurpassable for AI.
I would be really grateful for any opinions and suggestions concerning the above questions and the proposed framework of debate."


![extra_4](./assets/extra_4.png)

**6. AI's Role in Medical Knowledge**
**Context**: AI's capability to generate new knowledge versus merely interpolating existing data is crucial.
**Points to Consider**:

- AI in drug discovery and research.
- The risk of AI perpetuating medical myths or outdated practices.

**7. AI's Strengths and Weaknesses in Medicine**
**Context**: A balanced view can help in understanding where AI can be genuinely transformative and where it falls short.
**Points to Consider**:

- AI's superiority in data analysis and pattern recognition.
- Human skills like empathy, complex decision-making, and ethical reasoning that AI cannot replicate.

**Suggestions for the Debate**

1. **Expert Testimonies**: Invite professionals who have firsthand experience with AI in medicine.
2. **Case Studies**: Present real-world examples to make the debate more relatable.
3. **Audience Participation**: Allow the audience to ask questions or vote on certain issues to make the debate more interactive.
4. **Ethical and Legal Framework**: Discuss the ethical and legal implications to provide a comprehensive view.
5. **Future Outlook**: Conclude with what the future could look like in both scenarios: one with AI deeply integrated into medicine and one without.

I hope these elaborations prove helpful in shaping a robust and enlightening debate.
